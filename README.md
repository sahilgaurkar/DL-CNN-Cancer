# DL-CNN-Cancer
**Identifying Cancer Samples Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**



Developed a deep neural network model that achieved a remarkable 94% accuracy in detecting cancer cells.  
Utilized PyTorch for modelling 8-layer deep CNN, incorporating techniques such as class balancing, Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning with Ray-tune.  
Employed 3 Captum for model interpretation and analysis like Grad-CAM, Saliency Map, and Layer Activation.
